Nowadays, administrative tasks can consume up to 30% of clinicians' working hours, diverting attention from patient care and contributing to physician burnout. The MediSpeech project aims to reduce administrative waste in healthcare by creating an open digital healthcare ecosystem for automated medical reporting. The proposed solution uses AI-powered speech recognition, data interoperability and harmonisation, and technology-advanced clinical decision support to transform the healthcare model into a patient/doctor-centered approach.

The [Medispeech project](https://itea4.org/project/medispeech.html) kicks-off in January 2025 and will run for 3 years until December 2027. Medispeech is led by [MedRecord BV](https://medrecord.io/) and is a large consortium including 22 organisations in 5 countries.
