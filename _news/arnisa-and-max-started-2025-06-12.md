[Arnisa Fazla](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dvDEcd0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Maxim Popov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-pop0v/) officially joined our lab as PhD students last month! Arnisa works in the [CaRe-NLP project](projects/carenlp_project) and Max in the [Medispeech project](projects/medispeech_project). Arnisa will work on methods for annotation disagreement and uncertainty quantification with LLMs in healthcare, and Max will work on methods that bridge automatic speech recognition and NLP to automate reporting and reduce clinicians' administrative burden. Welcome, Arnisa and Max!
